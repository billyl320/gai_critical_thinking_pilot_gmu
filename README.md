# Pilot Study on GAI and Critical Thinking in Higher Education Classrooms

This GitHub is associated with the preprint titled "Pilot Study on GAI and Critical Thinking in Higher Education Classrooms".  This pilot study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in educational settings, specifically within two introductory data science courses at George Mason University (GMU). The study aims to assess whether GAI aids in enhancing students' critical thinking skills by evaluating their ability to interpret and critique GAI outputs. The research employs a quasi-experimental design, comparing treatment groups exposed to a 15-minute lecture on GAI with control groups. Preliminary findings suggest that targeted lesson plans incorporating GAI may positively impact critical thinking related to GAI outputs. The study highlights the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating GAI into curricula, paving the way for more comprehensive future research to refine and expand upon these initial insights.
